# smlpkg

This program constitutes a generic package manager for Standard ML
libraries and programs. The package manager assumes nothing and knows
nothing about the Standard ML compilers used and is thus quite
generic. The package manager is almost a complete port of the Futhark
package manager, designed, and implemented in Haskell by Troels
Henriksen.
